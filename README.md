This project explores fundamental image processing techniques, covering basic image signal processing (ISP), advanced denoising, edge enhancement, and HDR imaging. 
In the ISP section, it implements demosaicing, white balance (using a gray-world algorithm), Gaussian denoising, gamma correction, and sharpening to prepare raw images for display. 
The project then compares traditional and AI-based denoising methods (using median, bilateral, and optionally pre-trained AI models) and applies edge enhancement through Laplacian filtering. 
Finally, it simulates HDR imaging by merging multi-exposure photos and applying tone mapping, improving detail in high-contrast scenes. 
Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive look at essential image processing workflows.
